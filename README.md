## 1. The Challenge

In Ontario, ambulances get to the patient in 9 minutes 90% of the time. We all know that
that the first few minutes after an emergency occurs is critical, and the difference of
just a few minutes could mean the difference between life and death.
Doctors Within Borders aims to get the closest responder within 5 minutes of
the patient to arrive on scene so as to give the patient the help needed earlier.
