## 1. The Challenge

In Ontario, ambulances get to the patient in 9 minutes 90% of the time. We all know that
that the first few minutes after an emergency occurs is critical, and the difference of
just a few minutes could mean the difference between life and death.
Doctors Within Borders aims to get the closest responder within 5 minutes of
the patient to arrive on scene so as to give the patient the help needed earlier.

## 2. Main Features

### a. Web view: the dispatcher

The dispatcher takes down information about an ongoing emergency from a 911 call, and dispatches a Doctor with the help of our dashboard.

### b. Mobile view: the Doctor

A Doctor is a certified individual who is registered with Doctors Within Borders. Each Doctor is identified by their unique code.

The Doctor can choose when they are on duty.

On-duty Doctors are notified whenever a new emergency occurs that is both within a reasonable distance and the Doctor's certified skill level.
